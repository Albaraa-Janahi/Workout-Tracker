Background: I am planning to convert from gym to calisthenics home workout. I want a web app that helps me organize my workout and track progress. This will be for personal use, so the entire app will be as frontend only, built using ReactJS.

Main Features:
1- Create an exercises, for each i should be able to specify:
    a- name
    b- type: Warmup | Stretching | Main
    c- Target muscle
    d- secondry muscle
2- Create a workout, for each i should be able to specify:
    a- name
    c- exercises (from already created list)
    d- Muscles Covered (auto populated based on selected exercises)
    e- Recomeneded day of the week
3- Workout Session, which i can pick the workout i would like to train now to track the current status of my workout and record everything in rest sessions

Screens:
1- Create Exercise: A screen that is responsible of creating, editting, and deleting exercises.
2- Create Workout: A screen that is responsibe of creating, editting, and deleting workouts.
3- Profile: A screen will allow me to edit my name, also showing statistics and insights about my workouts.
4- Session: A screen i will use during my workout, it will have a timer that is default 100 seconds, i will use it for the rest between sets. Also, a table showing all the exercises, and the current one i am doing now. Once done from each i click on a button with tick symbol which highlights the next excercise in the table. The table should show me the past values i mean reps and sets for each exercise that last time i trained on to compare, and empty fields that i have to fill during my workout, reps and sets.

Important notes:
1- Make sure to organize the repo properly and to include good comments while writting the code so i can change things later.
2- Everything will be stored locally in the project as JSON, so we can load it when needed.
3- No users required as it is just me, only one user created directly in the code and no need to sign in.
